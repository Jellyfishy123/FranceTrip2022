About: Hey everone! I'm Tien Dat, a freshman from NTU CSEC. This is my first coding project and I'm very excited to present it to the public. Using my limited knowledge and expertise of HTML5 and CSS (through hours of YouTube videos and a huge shoutout to CodeCampAcademy), I created an animated, informative and user-friendly website about my Winter Language Immersion Program (LIP) to France, organized by NTU and the University of Franche-Comt√©. This website serves primarily to attract students who want to experience learning French in a professional setting and life in France. I'm planning to do more of such projects when I travel overseas again. However, the website can only show its full form on my computer but the background and structure of the code is available here. Please do not hesitate to read out to me for more information (tiendat311003@gmail.com). Thank you for reading!

P.S Feel free to use and view the photos and videos as they're not copyrigted by me. I would like to thank my travel buddies and classmates Tsusha, Kai Yee, Ting En, Annabelle, Pradhiv, Ryan, Tessa, Judith, May, Pascal, Wan Qi for being by my side on this wonderful and memorable trip. I would also like to thank Stephanie and Frederique for being the best French professors we can ever ask for.
